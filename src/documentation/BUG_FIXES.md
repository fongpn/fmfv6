## React Ref Warning Fix

### Problem
The application was showing React warnings about function components not being able to receive refs:

```
Warning: Function components cannot be given refs. Attempts to access this ref will fail. Did you mean to use React.forwardRef()?
```

### Root Cause
The `Input` component was not properly handling refs that `react-hook-form`'s `register` function provides. When using `{...register('fieldName')}`, React Hook Form passes a `ref` prop to connect the input to the form state, but our Input component wasn't set up to receive refs.

### Solution
✅ **Modified `src/components/ui/Input.tsx`**:
- Wrapped the component with `React.forwardRef()`
- Added proper ref forwarding to the underlying `<input>` element
- Added `displayName` for better debugging

### Technical Details

#### Before (Problematic):
```tsx
export function Input({ className, label, error, helperText, id, ...props }: InputProps) {
  return (
    <input
      // No ref handling
      {...props}
    />
  );
}
```

#### After (Fixed):
```tsx
export const Input = React.forwardRef<HTMLInputElement, InputProps>(
  ({ className, label, error, helperText, id, ...props }, ref) => {
    return (
      <input
        ref={ref}  // Properly forwards ref
        {...props}
      />
    );
  }
);

Input.displayName = 'Input';
```

### Impact
- ✅ Eliminates React warnings in console
- ✅ Ensures proper form field registration with React Hook Form
- ✅ Maintains all existing functionality
- ✅ Improves debugging with proper component display name

### Form Validation Status
With this fix, the form validation should now work correctly:
- React Hook Form can properly register the input fields
- Validation errors should display appropriately
- Form submission should capture field values correctly

### Testing
After this fix:
1. Open browser developer tools
2. Check that React warnings are gone
3. Try logging in with demo credentials
4. Verify that validation works as expected
5. Check console logs for form data debugging

This fix resolves the underlying issue that was preventing proper form field registration and validation.
