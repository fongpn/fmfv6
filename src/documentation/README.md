# FMF Gym Management System - Documentation

## Overview

The FMF Gym Management System is a comprehensive business management application designed specifically for single-gym operations. Built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase, it provides secure, reliable management of members, staff, financial transactions, and operational workflows.

## Phase 1 Implementation - Foundation & Core Infrastructure

### Completed Features

#### 1. Database Schema & Migrations
- **Complete database schema** with 14 interconnected tables
- **Row Level Security (RLS)** enabled on all tables with role-based policies
- **Performance indexes** for frequently queried columns
- **Business logic constraints** and data validation
- **Audit trail capabilities** with created_at/updated_at timestamps

#### 2. Authentication & User Management
- **Supabase Authentication** integration
- **Role-based access control** (ADMIN, CS roles)
- **Profile management** linked to auth.users
- **Secure session handling** with automatic token refresh
- **Location-based access control** foundation for CS users

#### 3. Core Infrastructure
- **Zustand state management** for authentication
- **React Router** for navigation
- **Form validation** with React Hook Form and Zod
- **Responsive UI components** with Tailwind CSS
- **TypeScript** for type safety throughout

#### 4. Admin Panel Structure
- **Sidebar navigation** with role-based menu filtering
- **Header component** with user info and logout
- **Layout system** with responsive design
- **Dashboard** with real-time statistics
- **System Settings** management interface

### Database Tables

#### Core Business Tables
1. **system_settings** - Global configuration (grace periods, rates, etc.)
2. **profiles** - Staff user profiles with roles
3. **members** - Gym member records
4. **membership_plans** - Admin-defined membership templates
5. **memberships** - Individual membership purchases/renewals
6. **shifts** - Staff shift management with cash reconciliation
7. **transactions** - Central financial transaction log
8. **check_ins** - Member entry/access log

#### Supporting Tables
9. **allowed_ips** - IP addresses for CS role location control
10. **access_requests** - Pending IP approval workflow
11. **coupon_templates** - Admin-defined coupon templates
12. **sold_coupons** - Individual coupons sold to members
13. **products** - POS inventory items
14. **stock_movements** - Inventory change history

### Key Business Logic Implemented

#### 1. Shift-Based Operations
- All financial transactions must be linked to an active shift
- Cash reconciliation with starting/ending balances
- Discrepancy tracking and reporting

#### 2. Membership Management
- Grace period logic for expired memberships
- Registration fees for new members only
- Promotional benefits (free months) on plans
- Historical tracking with separate membership records

#### 3. Security & Access Control
- Role-based permissions (ADMIN vs CS)
- Location-based access control for CS users
- Edge Functions for secure login workflows
- RLS policies protecting sensitive data

### Edge Functions

#### 1. secure-login
- Handles location-based access control for CS users
- Creates access requests for new IP addresses
- Returns pending status for admin approval

#### 2. resolve-access-request
- Allows admins to approve/deny CS access requests
- Automatically adds approved IPs to allowed list
- Maintains audit trail of approval decisions

### UI Components

#### 1. Reusable Components
- **Button** - Multiple variants and sizes
- **Input** - Form input with validation display
- **Card** - Content containers with header/footer
- **Layout** - Main application structure

#### 2. Authentication
- **LoginForm** - Secure login with validation
- **AuthStore** - Centralized authentication state

#### 3. Navigation
- **Sidebar** - Role-based navigation menu
- **Header** - User info and quick actions

### Current Pages

#### 1. Dashboard
- Real-time statistics (active members, revenue, shifts)
- Quick action buttons
- Recent activity feed
- Pending notifications

#### 2. System Settings
- Global configuration management
- Form validation and error handling
- Real-time updates with optimistic UI

### Development Standards

#### 1. Code Organization
- Modular file structure with clear separation of concerns
- TypeScript for type safety
- Consistent naming conventions
- Comprehensive error handling

#### 2. Security
- Environment variables for sensitive data
- RLS policies on all database tables
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure authentication flows

#### 3. Performance
- Database indexes for query optimization
- Lazy loading and code splitting
- Optimistic UI updates
- Efficient state management

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

The foundation is now complete and ready for Phase 2 implementation:

1. **Core Business Operations**
   - Shift Management interface
   - Member CRUD operations
   - Membership Plans management
   - Member validation system with grace period logic

2. **Transaction Processing**
   - POS sales interface
   - Membership sales and renewals
   - Cash reconciliation workflows
   - Financial reporting

3. **Advanced Features**
   - Coupon system implementation
   - Inventory management
   - Staff management interface
   - Network access control UI

The system architecture supports scalability for 6000+ members and 500+ daily transactions, with proper indexing and query optimization in place.
